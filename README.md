# Town Generator

A procedural world-generation tool for a CLI RPG I'm developing. üè∞

- Randomly generates towns with buildings, rooms, NPCs, chests, and more.
- Exports world data as a JSON file and town connections as a DOT file.
- Configurable via a settings file for customization.
- Supports importing a modified DOT file to regenerate town data.
